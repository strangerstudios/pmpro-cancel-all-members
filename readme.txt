Cancel all members in a Paid Memberships Pro site. Warning! Use at your own risk.

== Description ==

Activate this plugin, then navigate to /wp-admin/?cancelallmembers=1 as an admin.

To cancel only a few members at a time (to avoid time outs) add a limit parameter,
e.g. /wp-admin/?cancelallmembers=1&limit=10 will cancel 10 members.
